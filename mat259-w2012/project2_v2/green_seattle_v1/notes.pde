Revised

The bivariate graph will show days of the month vs time periods (by hr) of each day.

Within each day I will show the concentration or total number of books checked out that 
fit within a certain grouping (based on my 7 categories). The more checkouts there are at that time, 
the brighter the color assigned to the category is. The less books that are checked out, the darker the color is. 

Only one category will be shown across the board at a time. This is selectable by picking 
the category on the left side. 

With each day column showing the concentration of books checked out I can hover over a 
particular square and see the books that were checked out that day in a popup box. 
When this happens the rest of the display in the background darkens a little to put 
emphasis on the current selection. 

Questions: 
Who is the user?

It seems the user would be someone looking for popular books in the categories of conservation, sustainability, or any others. 
This tool would allow them to explore what people are checking out and at what time periods these books seem to be checked out most often.

The simplest way to build this is to 

layout grid and axes

query and prepare data

filter data coming in and break it up into its components

draw it

I need

title, year, month, day, cout time, cat1, cat2, cat3, cat4, cat5, cat6, cat7
